//! Contract tests for the Rust build standard.
//!
//! The standard makes the parallel `rustc` frontend and, on Linux, mold the
//! default for every development build. Cargo applies one `rustflags` source
//! rather than merging them, and an assigned `RUSTFLAGS` replaces every source,
//! so the flags are repeated in each configuration source, restated by each
//! development recipe, and kept out of the coverage and release recipes. The
//! Makefile clauses read what `make -n` prints on a Linux and a macOS host; each
//! listed `setup-rust` step passes `install-mold`. Fixtures come first, so no
//! rule passes by detecting nothing.
