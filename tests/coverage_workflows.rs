//! Holds `CodeScene` coverage publication on `main`, per concordat's CV-005.
//!
//! The rule has three clauses, and this file asserts each of them:
//!
//! 1. no workflow a pull request can reach invokes a `CodeScene` action, runs `cs-coverage`,
//!    contacts `codescene.io`, receives `CS_ACCESS_TOKEN`, forwards every secret with `secrets:
//!    inherit`, or publishes its coverage report;
//! 2. every `generate-coverage` step such a workflow runs sets `with-ratchet: true`, with baseline
//!    paths matching the main publisher's;
//! 3. exactly one workflow triggered by a push restricted to `main` generates ratcheted coverage
//!    and uploads it through the shared action, passing the token straight to its input behind
//!    the token check's answer and a `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` conjunct, in a concurrency
//!    group that never cancels a run in progress.
//!
//! Why each clause is worth a test rather than a convention: a pull request
//! from a fork cannot read `secrets.CS_ACCESS_TOKEN`, so an upload step on the
//! pull-request lane is silently inert for exactly the changes that most need
//! reviewing, and `CodeScene` accepts an upload only for a branch it analyses,
//! which a pull request head is not. Both failures are quiet. Nothing goes
//! red; the data simply never arrives.
//!
//! "A workflow a pull request can reach" is a closure, not a trigger list. A
//! workflow declaring only `workflow_call` never names a pull request, yet a
//! pull-request job can call it with `secrets: inherit` and hand it the token.
//! [`reader::pull_request_closure`] follows local calls until nothing new is
//! reached, and every pull-request clause runs over what it returns.
//!
//! The judgements live in [`rules`] and [`publisher_rules`] and are driven
//! directly against complying and breaching fixtures in `pull_request_cases`
//! and `publisher_cases`, and the closure against generated call graphs in
//! `closure_properties`, because a rule exercised only over this repository's
//! own correct workflows would pass whether or not it detects anything. The
//! tests below then apply the same functions to the real files.
