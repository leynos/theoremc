Theorem: SecondEmptyAssumeExpr
About: Second assumption has an empty expr
Assume:
  - expr: "x > 0"
    because: first constraint is fine
  - expr: ""
    because: second constraint is blank
Prove:
  - assert: "true"
    because: trivially true
Evidence:
  kani:
    unwind: 1
    expect: SUCCESS
Witness:
  - cover: "true"
    because: always reachable
