Theorem: BlockAssumeExpr
About: Assume expr contains a block expression
Assume:
  - expr: "{ let x = 1; x }"
    because: test expression validation
Prove:
  - assert: "true"
    because: trivially true
Evidence:
  kani:
    unwind: 1
    expect: SUCCESS
Witness:
  - cover: "true"
    because: always reachable
