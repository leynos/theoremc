Theorem: NestedMaybeProof
About: Nested maybe blocks remain valid when all reasons and actions are present.
Let:
  baseline:
    must:
      action: account.params
      args: { max_balance: 1000 }
Do:
  - maybe:
      because: optional first branch
      do:
        - maybe:
            because: optional second branch
            do:
              - must:
                  action: account.validate
                  args: { account: { ref: baseline } }
Prove:
  - assert: "true"
    because: baseline theorem remains valid
Evidence:
  kani:
    unwind: 1
    expect: SUCCESS
Witness:
  - cover: "true"
    because: at least one path is reachable
