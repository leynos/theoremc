theorem: LowerAliasMustFlow
about: Lowercase aliases with must bindings remain supported.
let:
  start:
    must:
      action: account.params
      args: { max_balance: 1000 }
do:
  - must:
      action: account.validate
      args: { account: { ref: start } }
prove:
  - assert: "true"
    because: flow uses lowercase aliases and must
evidence:
  kani:
    unwind: 1
    expect: SUCCESS
witness:
  - cover: "true"
    because: witness policy remains satisfied
